# Frontend Mentor Challenge - Social Proof Section

## Hi There! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge from [Frontend Mentor](http://frontendmentor.io).

It was really exciting working on this project because I got to practice building assymetrical layouts with CSS grids and flexbox and also it was the first time I attempted a challenge on [Frontend Mentor](http://frontendmentor.io).

The challenge was to build out this social proof section and get it looking as close to the design as possible on desktop and responsive on mobile.

We were encouraged to use any tools we like to complete the challenge so I decided to go with React JS even though it was a fairly simple UI to build out. I just really needed to practice my React skills.
